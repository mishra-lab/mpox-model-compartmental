\section{Methods}
We constructed a deterministic compartmental \SVEIR
(susceptible, vaccinated, exposed, infectious, recovered)
model of \MPXV transmission.
The modelled population aimed to represent the Ontario \GBMSM community,
and included two levels of sexual risk (higher, lower)
and two weakly connected transmission networks (cities A, B).
Figure~\ref{fig:model.city.risk} illustrates the modelled city/risk strata,
Figure~\ref{fig:model.sveir} illustrates the \SVEIR health states, and
Table~\ref{tab:model.params} summarizes the default model parameters.
To parameterize the model, we drew on
prior analyses of \GBMSM sexual networks in Canada \cite{Wang2021,Armstrong2020},
and emerging \MPXV epidemiological data in the context of the current epidemic
\cite{PHO2022synth,Adler2022,Thornhill2022,Charniga2022,Miura2022}.
Appendix~\ref{app.model} provides additional details about
the model implementation and parameterization.

We initialized all model runs with 10 imported/seed cases,
distributed across the exposed and infectious stages proportionally by mean stage duration.
We then simulated distribution of 5000 vaccine doses over 15 days,
60 days after initial cases were imported (though not necessarily detected).
Doses were imperfectly prioritized to the higher risk group with 90\% sensitivity
--- i.e. 4500 doses reach the higher risk group and 500 each the low risk group,
reflecting early risk-based eligibility criteria in some jurisdictions \cite{TPH2022vax}.
\par
Using this model, we explored optimal vaccine allocation between cities A~and~B
over a range of epidemic conditions.
For a given set of conditions, we defined the optimal vaccine allocation as that which
resulted in the fewest cumulative infections by day 120 in both cities.%
\footnote{Optimal allocation was identified using the
  \href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/link/optimize?package=stats}
  {\texttt{optimize}} function in R.}
\par
We chose this 60-day time horizon and fixed 5000 vaccine doses to reflect
a plausible medium-term optimization problem relevant to the early \MPXV situation in Ontario.
In reality, multiple changing time horizons may require consideration,
different numbers of doses may become available, and
different rates of vaccination may be possible.
We aimed to obtain generalizable insights about the relationships between
specific epidemic conditions and efficient geographic prioritization of vaccines during an outbreak.
\par
As one specific example setting, we chose parameters representative of
Toronto (city~A) and another medium-sized Ontario city (city~B),
with \GBMSM population sizes of 80,000 and 20,000, respectively,
and 10\% sexual/social network connectivity ($\epsilon_c = 0.9$) \cite{Armstrong2020}.
We also modelled $R_0$ = 2.0 in Toronto versus 1.5 in city~B,
reflecting differences in sexual network density as suggested by differential prevalence of
bacterial sexually transmitted infections across Ontario cities \cite{Gesink2014,Hart2021}.
Finally, we simulated 100\% imported/seed cases in Toronto,
reflecting early \MPXV case distribution in Ontario \cite{PHO2022ont}.
We then compared two strategies of vaccine allocation by city:
(a) proportional to population size; and
(b) ``optimal'' (fewest infections by day 120).
\par
Next, we performed a ``grid sweep'' of the following epidemic conditions,
and identified the optimal vaccine allocation between cities A and B
for each combination of conditions:
\clearpage % TEMP
\begin{itemize}
  \item relative size of city A versus B (1/4~to~4 times)
  \item relative epidemic potential in city~A ($R_0$ in city~A from 1~to~2, versus fixed 1.5 in city~B),%
  \footnote{City-specific $R_0$ calculated assuming no inter-city mixing.}
        adjusted via the sexual activity of the higher risk group in the city~A
  \item between-city mixing (0~to~30\% of all contacts formed randomly between cities)
  \item fraction of imported/seed cases in city A versus B (0--100\%)
\end{itemize}
