We sought to explore optimal allocation of a fixed supply of monkeypox vaccine
across two cities --- i.e. weakly connected transmission networks ---
under different epidemic conditions.
Specifically, we explored differences between cities in:
population size; epidemic potential ($R_0$); imported/seed cases;
and connectedness of the cities.
The transmission network explored was loosely representative of
Ontario gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM),
reflecting the Ontario population with highest monkeypox burden at present.
However, our aim was not to precisely model specific Ontario cities,
but to produce generalizeable insights into efficient vaccine prioritization.
