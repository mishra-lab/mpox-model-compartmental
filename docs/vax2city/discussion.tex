\section{Discussion}
We sought to explore how different epidemic conditions
could affect optimal allocation of a fixed supply of monkeypox vaccine
across two weakly connected transmission networks (e.g. cities).
Under our modelling assumptions, we found that
vaccines could generally avert more infections when prioritized to
a larger city,
a city with more initial infections, and
a city with greater epidemic potential $R_0$
defined by contact rates in a higher risk group.
