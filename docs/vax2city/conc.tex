\section{Conclusion}
Strategic prioritization of a limited vaccine supply by network-level risk factors
can maximize infections averted over short time horizons
in the context of an emerging epidemic, such as the current global \MPXV outbreak.
Notable factors include:
the network size,
distribution of initial cases,
relative epidemic potential within a given network, and
connectivity between networks.
Such epidemic potential is defined not just by possible modes of transmission but by
network configuration, access to prevention and care,
and by underlying social and structural contexts.
Efforts to understand and anticipate epidemic potential across and between different networks
before outbreaks occur can support rapid response.
Such efforts should be paired with resource prioritization
to eliminate existing disparities in health care access and outcomes.
